      <p>Hi there! I'm Cassandra, an aspiring designer navigating the world of graphic and web design at Front Range Community College. Although I'm still sharpening my skills, my passion lies in creating designs that not only look good but also serve a purpose. While I may not boast years of industry experience just yet, I'm already immersing myself in various projects, gaining hands-on insights.</p>

      <p>In my design journey, I draw inspiration from my travels and diverse experiences. I'm on the exciting venture of earning a Bachelor's in Business for Creative Industries through FRCC, fueling my dream of establishing my own design business. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, drawing, puzzle-solving, movies, adventurous activities, and music. My design philosophy revolves around cultivating a mindset of curiosity, constantly questioning and seeking new ideas, inspirations, and possibilities. This philosophy drives my creative process, pushing me to explore new designs. Thanks for stopping by and taking a peek into my evolving design story!</p>
